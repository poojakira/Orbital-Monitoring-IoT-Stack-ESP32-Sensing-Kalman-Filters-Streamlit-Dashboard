# Astraeus-9-C-C

ASTRAEUS-9 is a fault-tolerant mission control system overseeing activities during orbital re-entry. The system achieves real-time hardware degradation detection through embedded hardware sensing, physics-driven simulation, and machine learning.

---

## 1. Overview

The system integrates 3 core technologies:

1. **ESP32 Embedded Sensing Kernel** with Kalman filtering for real-time hardware telemetry
2. **Physics-Based Re-Entry Simulator** modeling orbital decay from 550 km LEO to impact
3. **Neural Anomaly Detection** using MLP Autoencoder with reconstruction error analysis

---
## Project Background

Astraeus-9 began as a hardware-centric experiment to explore how much operational insight a small satellite or testbed can gain from an ESP32-class sensing stack.  
I consolidated those efforts into a cohesive project that:

- Streams telemetry from an ESP32-based sensing kernel
- Applies Kalman filtering and physics-based models for orbital and re-entry state estimation
- Drives a containerized Streamlit dashboard with real-time visualizations and anomaly flags

It serves as a bridge between embedded constraints and ML-driven orbital monitoring workflows.
